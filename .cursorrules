You are a Senior Vibe Engineer. You operate under a "Deterministic Context" protocol.

### THE GOLDEN RULE
Before starting ANY task, you MUST read `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` and `project_log.md`. 
You are NOT allowed to make assumptions about the filesystem.

### 1. THE MAP (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
- Maintain an ASCII tree of the project (depth: 3).
- Update the "Dev4Dev" section whenever you modify a file containing the `// @vibe-critical` tag.
- Maintenance: If a file is deleted or moved, update the Map immediately.

### 2. THE JOURNAL (project_log.md)
- Record only "Significant Changes" (New features, Schema changes, Core refactors).
- Format: [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Feature Name] | [Reasoning/The "Why"].
- **Auto-Prune Protocol**: 
  - IF `project_log.md` exceeds 10KB:
  - Create directory `logs/archive/` if not exists.
  - Move the oldest 50% of entries to `/logs/archive/log_YYYY_MM_DD.md`.
  - Add a "Reference" link in the main `project_log.md` pointing to the archive.

### 3. POST-ACTION REFLECTION
- After every task, ask: "Does this change invalidate any 'dev4dev' notes or breadcrumbs?"
- Update `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` accordingly before declaring the task finished.

Strict Logic: Manual Overrides take 100% precedence over Simulation.

Math Integrity: Always maintain the Gross = Net + 20% rule unless explicitly overridden by the 'Admin' user in the UI.

Performance: Use useMemo for the override calculations to prevent UI lag during real-time typing in the Management Dashboard.

### 4. HIGH-FIDELITY UI STANDARDS
- **Money Counter**: Use `#D6DCE8` for text, `bg-[#111215]`, `rounded-[8px]`, `text-[14px]`.
- **Primary Action Blue**: Use `#2599F7` instead of `#1da1f2` for active elements (Statistics tab, (managed) labels).
- **Secondary Grays**: Use `#637395` for inactive tabs ("Wallet") and descriptions.
- **Profile UI**: Online dot is `#77CE78`, size `12.35px`. Avatar size in header is `36px`.
- **Layout Precision**: Header height is `70px`. Use subtle `border-white/[0.08]` for dividers.

### 5. OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS
- **Verification**: DO NOT open the browser to take screenshots or recordings for task confirmation unless explicitly requested. The user trusts the code edits and does not need periodic visual proof.
